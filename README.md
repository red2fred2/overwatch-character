# Random Overwatch character selector

### overwatch-character

If you are an indecisive Overwatch player like I am, you often wonder if you are accidentally becoming a Hanzo main. Well no more! The random 
Overwatch character selector allows you to:

- Stop being a Hanzo main

- Play Winston

- Git gud scrub

- Realize how to counter characters

- Not be trash in a random heroes match

## for people who are interested in the code
*(of course you are, you are on github)*

Here is the gist of each file:

- The app folder contains the server side application code

- The build folder has the ugly ass minified stuff that goes to the client

- gulp contains all of the gulp related code *Who would have guessed that?*

- source has all of the nice looking and hopefully reusable bits

- temp is used during the build process

- utilities has all of the super abstract code that has no real home

- build.sh makes it easier to run all of the build scripts

- gulpfile.js is the gulp file *duh*

- LICENSE, that thing that you won't read, and won't honor

- package.json is an ugly way of saying what all is used in this application

- README.md **THIS** *pay attention dummy*
